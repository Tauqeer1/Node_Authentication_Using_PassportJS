# Node_Authentication_Using_PassportJS



In this project I have done node.js using passport.js  authentication

So what is passport.js authentication ?

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
Passport.js has 300+ authentication strategies.

Feature's of this project.

		Local account logins and signups (using passport-local)
		Facebook logins and registration (using passport-facebook)
		Twitter logins and registration (using passport-twitter)
		Google+ logins and registration (using oauth with passport-google-oauth)
		Require login for certain routes/sections of your application
		Creating a password hash for local accounts (using bcrypt-nodejs)
		Displaying error messages (using flash with connect-flash. required since express 3.x)
